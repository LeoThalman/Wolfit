## About Wolfit
Wolfit is a simple reddit style app developed in Python that started with a monolithic architecture and was used to gain experience with migrating a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture  and other related skills such as Test Driven Development, Load Balancing, Cloud Deployment and both working with and creating REST APIs. The majority of changes to this app involve improving test coverage and moving the activity log to it's own microservice, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/LeoThalman/Activity-Log)
